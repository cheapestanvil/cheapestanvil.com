Before creating an issue, please go over following checklist to verify that there is a bug in the algorithm.

### Check anvil uses (penalty) of each item

To do so, just put the item in an anvil, change the name and check the enchantment costs. Beware, you shouldn't actually rename the item.

- Enchantment Costs: 1 → 0 anvil uses
- Enchantment Costs: 2 → 1 anvil uses
- Enchantment Costs: 4 → 2 anvil uses
- Enchantment Costs: 8 → 3 anvil uses
- Enchantment Costs: 16 → 4 anvil uses
- Enchantment Costs: 32 → 5 anvil uses

### Check if your item is used

If at least one of your items is used (shows a colored health bar at the bottom of the item) and you combine it with another item, it may add 2 levels to the enchantment costs. These are the repair costs.

--------------------------

Once you verified everything, please describe the problem as detailed as possible.

### Scenario
- Copy and paste the browser url

--OR--

- List all Items with
- Material (if available)
- Durability (if available)
- Anvil uses (penalty)
- Enchantments including levels and if required
